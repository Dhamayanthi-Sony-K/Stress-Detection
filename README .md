# Stress Detection Using Text Classification  

## Overview  
This project aims to detect stress in textual data using machine learning classification algorithms. It preprocesses text, extracts features, and applies Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and SVM models to classify whether a given text indicates stress or not.  

## Features  
- Cleans and preprocesses text using NLP techniques (stemming, stopword removal).  
- Uses CountVectorizer for feature extraction.  
- Implements Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, and SVM classifiers for stress detection.  
- Provides interactive user input prediction.  
- Evaluates models using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.  

## Target Audience  
- Researchers and developers interested in NLP-based mental health applications.  
- Data scientists exploring text classification models.  
- Mental health professionals seeking AI-driven stress analysis.
